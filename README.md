#About
This is mainly a coding excercise for my own benifit but does have some useful applications.

The tools/library allow strings such as "f(x,y,z)=10+2\*x+3^y+sin(z)" to be transformed into useable C++ classes.

These classes can then be computed eg f(1,2,3) or simplified if possible e.g "f(x) = 15 + 20 + x" -> "f(x)= 35 + x"

#Features
Functionality will be added slowly as I find time.
